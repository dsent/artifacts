# Project Backlog (Simplified)

Simple prioritized list. No detailed plans.

## P0

- Bug: When switching from hard to other difficulties, an indicator of 'line clear danger' is shown despite those difficulties not having line clear death mechanics.
- Fix sabotage mechanics (add a separate difficulty setting that can't be selected by user, but is applied temporarily when sabotaging; should incentivize building debris and heavily penalize both line clears and dropping pieces on the user)
- Set debug enabled or disabled by deployment scripts (disabled for production, enabled for dev/running locally).

## P1

- Fix starting screen/pause layout (it's ugly now).
- Add sound effects.
- Add background music.
- Add mobile support (touch controls, responsive layout).
- Add Christmas theme (snow falling from Dec 20 to Jan 10).
