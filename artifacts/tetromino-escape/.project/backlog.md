# Project Backlog (Simplified)

Simple prioritized list. No detailed plans.

## P0

- Add Christmas theme (snow falling from Dec 20 to Jan 10).

## P1

- Add sound effects.
- Add background music.
- Add mobile support (touch controls, responsive layout).

## Completed

- 2025-12-31 (done): Fix starting screen/pause layout (it's ugly now).
- 2025-12-31 (done): Rendering updates: get rid of hardcoded colors, visually indicate sabotaged pieces.
- 2025-12-31 (done): Fix sabotage mechanics - added a separate "sabotage" difficulty setting that actively encourages building debris, heavily penalizes line clearing, and targets the player's danger zone.
- 2025-12-31 (done): Set debug enabled or disabled by deployment scripts (disabled for production, enabled for dev/running locally).
- 2025-12-30 (done): Bug: When switching from hard to other difficulties, an indicator of 'line clear danger' is shown despite those difficulties not having line clear death mechanics.
