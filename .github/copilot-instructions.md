# GitHub Copilot Instructions - Artifacts Monorepo

This repository is a monorepo for various artifacts.

## General Rules

Please refer to the root [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for comprehensive repository-wide conventions, coding standards, and artifact requirements.

When working within an artifact directory (e.g., `/artifacts/tetromino-escape/`), please prioritize the instructions found in that directory's `AGENTS.md`.
